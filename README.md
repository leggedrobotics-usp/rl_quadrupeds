# RL Quadrupeds

A library containing Reinforcement Learning algorithms to train policies for quadruped robots.

## Repository

This repository contains three main folders:
- docker
  
    Contains a Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration files to build and run a Docker image with ROS2 Humble, IsaacSim, and IsaacLab already configured for use.
- rl_quadrupeds
  
    Contains several Python packages with custom functionalities for training Reinforcement Learning policies for quadruped robots. It also includes a tasks folder with the complete definitions of already trained RL policies.
- ros2
  
    Contains ROS2 Humble packages that enable interaction between RL simulations and ROS2 nodes.

## Setting Up

Refer to each main folder's README file for setup instructions.
